Before joining the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicogenomics, I served as a Senior Research Fellow at the International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in New Delhi, India. Under the esteemed guidance of renowned scientists Dr. K.V.S. Rao and Dr. Pawan Sharma, I mastered recombinant molecular biology techniques, cell culture, and genome-wide microarray analysis, including in-vivo work. This experience significantly enriched my skill set and prepared me for advanced research in pharmacology and toxicogenomics
